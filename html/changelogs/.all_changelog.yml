  Cheridan:
  - rscadd: Experienced smugglers have joined the Syndicate, adding their bag of tricks
      to its arsenal. These tricky pouches can even fit under floor plating!
  Ikarrus:
  - wip: Adds Gang War, a new game mode still in alpha development.
  Incoming5643:
  - tweak: After a public relations nightmare in which a horde of 30 assistants violently
      dismembered a sole commander the revolution has begin tactically reducing their
      initial presence in stations with weak command structures. Should stations add
      to their command staff during the shift additional support will be provided.
  - tweak: Too many instances of crying CMOs hiding in the lockers of supposedly secured
      revoulutionary stations has lead to a crackdown on revolutionary policy. You
      must kill or maroon the entire command staff, reguardless of when they reached
      the station.
  - rscadd: Intense study into the underlying structure of the universe has revealed
      that everything fits into a massive SPACECUBE. This deep and profound understanding
      has led to a revolution in cross surface movement, and spacemen can look forward
      to a new era of predictable and safe space-fairing.
  Jordie0608:
  - tweak: Grille damage update, humans now deal less unarmed damage to grilles while
      projectiles and items deal more.
  - tweak: Replaced all AI turrets with porta-turrets that work on LoS instead of
      area and can be individually configured
  Miauw:

      hand. They start off.
  - experiment: The amount of TC has been increased to 20, but the price of all items

  - experiment: With this, the prices of stealthy items has been slightly decreased
      and the prices of offensive items slightly increased (+/- 1 TC)
  RemieRichards, JJRcop:

      Drones, little robots capable of repairing and improving the station. Unfortunately,
      all of the research was lost in a catastrophic server fire, but we know they
      can be made, so it's up to <b><i>you</i></b> to re-discover them! Make us proud!
  phil235:

      to avoid confusion with genetics mutations.

      attackers should they be assaulted during their shifts.
  - bugfix: Toolbelts can now hold pocket fire extinguishers. Atmos technicians spawn
      with them.
  - rscadd: Remember those magboots we had our undercover agents steal? Well we've
      finally reverse engineered them. Not only that, but we gave them a killer paintjob.
      They will be available in the uplinks of boarding parties we send out to Nanoscum
      stations.
  - rscadd: Listen up, Marauders! The Syndicate has recently cut back funding into
      boarding parties. What this means is no more hi-tech fancy energy guns. We've

      flashes.

      syringes in medkits. Like the syringes, these can be used to stabilize patients
      in critical condition, but require no medical knowledge to use.
  - experiment: Reverted the mining scanner to a manual scanner.
  - bugfix: Buffed the rate of the automatic scanner
  - rscadd: Added automatic scanner to equipment locker. It is also available by redeeming
      your voucher.
  - bugfix: Reduced the size of the mining jetpack, it now fits in backpacks. The
      capacity of the jetpack has been reduced as well, however.

  JJRcop:
  - rscadd: We have managed to re-discover drones! We improved the formula, and have
      discovered some cool stuff.
  - rscadd: After some fiddling with audio recognition, drones can now understand
      human speech!
  - rscadd: One of our engineers found some screws that were loose on some of our
      tests, screwing them in made the drone work as if it had just come out of robotics.
  - tweak: We had to sacrifice some of our NT brand EMP protection for the speech
      recognition, so drones can get damaged if subjected to heavy EMP radiation.
  - bugfix: We figured out why drones couldn't remove objects from people, that has
      been fixed.
  - bugfix: The standby light wasn't wired correctly.
  - rscdel: Unfortunately one of our assistants tasked with transporting the only
      copy of the data dropped the flash drive in hot water because he wanted to see
      what "drone tea" tasted like. You'll have to discover them again.
  Lo6a4evskiy:
  - rscadd: Station's crayons have been upgraded to the version 2.0 of ColourOS. Don't
      worry, they are still edible!
  - tweak: Many items now have different stripping delays. Heavier and more armored
      pieces of clothing are generally more difficult to take off someone else, while
      smaller items can be very easy to snatch. Pockets always take 4 seconds to search.
  MrPerson:
  - rscadd: Implants are activated via action buttons on the top-left corner of your
      screen instead of emotes.
  Paprika:
  - rscadd: Added zipties for security and nuke operatives. These have a slightly
      shorter 'breakout time' as normal cuffs but they are destroyed upon removal.
      Beepsky and sec borgs now use these by default.
  - bugfix: Changed the medical HUD in the tactical medkit to a night vision HUD so
      syndicate medics don't stumble around in the dark. Can be purchased through
      nuke op uplinks.
  - rscadd: Added a second roboticist roundstart job slot.
  - rscadd: Added a third cargo tech job slot.
  Paprka:
  - rscadd: Added undershirts as a companion piece to jumpsuit adjusting. Beat the
      heat with a comfortable tank top, or warm up with an extra layer tshirt!
  - rscadd: Added a holographic sign projector to replace the old wet floor signs
      to encourage janitors to warn crewmembers about wet floors.
  optimumtact:

      conversion runes, but does NOT include sacrifice runes.
  Patchouli Knowledge:
  - rscadd: In light of the recent achievements of the Robotics department, new and
      upgraded exosuit schematics were delivered to SS13 exosuit fabricators as a
      reward from CentComm.
  - rscadd: The countless hours of research, experimentation, and reverse-engineering
      of wrecks from the mining asteroid have paid off - the Research team has rediscovered
      the process of building Phazon exosuits. The parts and circuits have been made
      available in the exofabs and circuit printers.
  - rscadd: The APLU Ripley exosuit has been refitted with asteroid mining purposes
      in mind. Its armour plating will provide extra protection against the brute
      attacks of asteroid alien lifeforms, and protect from gibtonite explosions.
      The leg servos were upgraded to provide faster movement.
  - rscadd: There are rumours of some creative shaft miners discovering a way of augmenting
      APLU Ripley armour with trophy hides from goliath-type asteroid lifeforms...
  - tweak: Durand construction routines now require a phasic scanner module and a
      super capacitor to match Nanotrasen industry standards.
  - tweak: The exosuit fire extinguisher now boasts a larger watertank, and carries
      a whole 1000u of water from the old 200u tank.
  - tweak: The exosuit plasma converter's efficiency has been vastly improved upon,
      and its fuel consumption has been cut to nearly half of old values.
  - bugfix: The exosuit sleeper interiors have been refitted to allow the occupants
      more freedom of movement, and the occupants may now eject at will.
  - bugfix: The armour plating on all exosuits was fitted with reactive deflection
      systems specifically designed to stop the rapid slashes from xenomorph threats.
  - bugfix: The Firefighter Ripley chassis were moved from the Exosuit Equipment section
      to the APLU Ripley section of exofab menus.
  - spellcheck: Fixed some minor errors in the exosuit construction message syntax.
  phil235:
  - rscadd: Closets and its children can no longer contain a near infinite amount
      of mobs. Large mobs (juggernaut, alien emperess, etc) don't fit, small mobs
      (mouse, parrot, etc) still fit in the same amounts, human-sized mob (humanoid,
      slime, etc) fit but maximum two per body bag and three for all the other closets.
      Adding bluespace body bag to R&D, it can hold even large mobs and in large amounts.
  - experiment: girders and displaced girders now have a chance to let projectiles
      pass through them.

  MrPerson:
  - rscadd: Everything now drifts in space, not just mobs.
  - rscadd: Mechs are just as maneuverable in space as you are.
  - tweak: Being weightless now slows movement down by a lot rather than speeding
      it up. Having your hands full will make movement even slower.
  - rscdel: Removed spaceslipping (You slipped! x1000)
  - bugfix: Jetpacking after being thrown out a mass driver will cancel out your momentum.
  - bugfix: Shooting a gun causes you to drift the other direction like spraying a
      fire extinguisher.

  MrPerson:
  - rscadd: You can use AI Upload modules directly on unslaved cyborgs to change their
      laws. The panel has to be open to do this.
  - bugfix: Newly emagged cyborgs get locked down for a little bit until their new
      laws get shown. Thank you to whoever bitched about it on singulo and filed an
      issue report.
  Paprika:
  - rscadd: Added an advanced mop for the janitor, available at the protolathe. This
      hi-tech custodian's friend can mop twice as many floor tiles before needing
      to return to your bucket!
  - tweak: Moved holosign projector to the protolathe and gave the janitor back his
      old signs. We hope you've enjoyed this free trial run of holo projectors, but
      our budget is tight!
  - rscadd: Added a holosign projector to the janitor module for cyborgs.
  - tweak: Soap now has a delay. Different soap types clean faster than others, but
      expect to put it some extra arm work if you want to clean that fresh blood!
  Tkdrg:
  - rscadd: Cutting-edge research in a secret Nanotransen lab has shed light into
      a revolutionary form of communication technology known as 'chat'. The Personal
      Data Assistants of Space Station 13 have been deployed with an experimental
      module implementing this system, dubbed 'Nanotransen Relay Chat'.

  - bugfix: Fixed infinigib/infinisplosion with meteors bumping
  Paprika:
  - rscadd: Added a defibrillator and an EMT alternative clothing set for medical
      doctors. These defibrillators will revive the recently deceased as long as their
      souls are occupying their body and they have no outstanding brute or burn damage.
  - bugfix: Yes, they actually work now too!
  - rscadd: Added a way for you to unload a round from a chambered projectile weapon.
      Simply click on the gun when it is in your active hand, and assuming it does
      not have a magazine, the round should pop out. You can also use this system
      to unload individual bullets from magazines and ammo boxes, like the detective's
      speed loaders.
  - rscadd: Added glass tables and overhauled how table construction works. Now, you
      need to build a frame using either metal rods or wood planks, and then place
      a top on the table.
  - tweak: Table disassembly now works in two stages. Screwdriver the table to remove
      the top of it and reduce it back to a frame. Frames can be moved around and
      walked on top of. Wrench the table to deconstruct it entirely back to parts,
      this is quicker and much more like the old fashion. To deconstruct a frame,
      use your wrench on it as well.
  - bugfix: Fixed traitor med analyzers not fitting in medical belts.
  - bugfix: Fixed syringe box bug with medipens.
  Perakp:
  - rscadd: Added escape-with-identity objective for changelings. Completion requires

      the blood sample useless for replica pod cloning.'
  GunHog:
  - rscadd: Our top Nanotrasen scientists have provided improved specifications for
      the Rapid Part Exchange Device (RPED)! The RPED can now contain up to 50 machine
      components, and will display identical items in groups when using its inventory
      interface.
  - rscadd: Note that power cells, being somewhat bulkier, will take up more space
      inside the device. In addition, the RPED's firmware has also been updated to
      assist in new machine construction! Simply have the required components inside
      the RPED, apply it to an unfinished machine with its circuit board installed,
      and watch as the device does the work!
  - rscadd: Nanotrasen has updated station bound Artificial Intelligence unit design
      specifications to include an integrated subspace radio transmitter. The transmitter
      is programmed with all standard department channels, along with the inclusion
      of its private channel. It is accessed using :o in its interface.
  - rscadd: '{INCOMING CLASSIFIED SYNDICATE TRANSMISSION} Greetings, agents! Today,
      we are happy to announce that we have successfully reverse engineered the new
      subspace radio found in Nanotrasen''s newest AI build plans. We have included
      our encryption data into these transmitters. '
  - rscadd: Should you be deployed with one of our agent AIs, it may be wise of you
      to purchase a syndicate encryption key in order to contact it securely. Remember,
      as with other agents, a Syndicate AI is unlikely to be of the same Syndicate
      corporation as you, and you both may actually have conflicting mission parameters!
      Your channel, as always, is accessed using :t.
  Paprika:
  - tweak: Changed the way flashbang protection works. Currently, only security helmets
      (and their derivatives like swat and riot), and some hardsuit helmets have flashbang
      protection. Ear items like earmuffs and 'bowman' headsets (alternative, larger
      headsets) have flashbang protection as well, so you're able to go hatless as
      security. The Head of security, warden, and detective's hat do NOT have flashbang
      protection, but their earpieces do, from the 'noise' part of the flashbang.
      The flashbang blind still works as before, with only sunglasses/hardsuit helmets
      protecting you.
  Tkdrg:
  - tweak: Security/Medical HUDs are now more responsive and less laggy.

  - tweak: To hear someone in space you need to be stood next to them, or use a radio
  as334:
  - rscadd: We've discovered that slimes react to the introduction of certain chemicals
      in their bloodstream. Inaprovaline will decrease the slimes children's chance
      of mutation, and plasma will increase it.
  - rscadd: We've also found that feeding slimes solid plasma bars makes them more
      friendly to humans.

  Paprika:
  - tweak: Reverted security armor and helmets to the old (Grey) style of armor/helmets.
  - tweak: Updated security jumpsuits to be more consistent across officer/warden/HoS
      ranks.

      vest in the armory. This armor has higher bullet and explosive resistance than
      normal armor, and uses the previous, more military armor/helmet sprites.
  - rscadd: Added a new injury doll to go along with the overall health meter. This
      will show you locational overall limb-based burn/brute damage, so you can tell
      the difference between being hurt with burn/brute or toxins/stamina damage which
      does not affect limbs.
  - tweak: Reverted some UI icons back to their older status and changed some around
      for readability. Thank you for your feedback.
  Thunder12345:
  - rscadd: Added a new FRAG-12 explosive shotgun shell, built from the unloaded technological
      shell, using tablecrafting. Constructed using an unloaded technological tech
      shell, 5 units sulphuric acid, 5 units polytrinic acid, 5 units glycerol, and
      requires a screwdriver.
  phil235:
  - rscadd: 'Change to the hunger system. Eating food with sugar temporarily worsens
      your nutrition drop rate. Eating too much sugar too quickly can make you temporarily
      unable to eat any sugary food. The nutritional effect of sugar depends on how
      hungry you are thus it cannot easily  raise your nutrition level past well fed
      and is best used when hungry. Lots of sugar can make you a bit jittery at times.
      Eating food with vitamin (new reagent) counteracts the sugar effects and can
      give you temporary buffs when well fed: it lowers your chance to catch or spread
      viruses,it makes your body''s metabolism more efficient that is it keeps healing
      reagents longer and evacuate toxins faster and reduces damage from radioactive
      reagents. Your metabolism gets less efficient if starving.'
  - rscadd: 'New hunger hud icons: starving, hungry, fed, well fed, full, fat.'
  - rscadd: Snack vending machine get a chef compartment that can be loaded with non-sugary
      food by hand or with a tray by anyone with kitchen access (unless you hack the
      machine with multitool or emag). The food can be unloaded by anyone, like regular
      snacks
  - rscadd: Cargo can get a nutritious pizza crate order for 60 points.
  - tweak: Grown and cooked food gets some vitamin while junk food gets less nutriment
      and more sugar (only hot donkpocket and ramen don't have sugar)
  - tweak: The number of junk food in snack vending machine is lowered from 6 to 5
      of each type.
  - bugfix: Fixing not being able to load an omelette du fromage on a tray.

  - experiment: The energy gun's stun mode has been replaced with a disable mode.
  - experiment: Security officers will now spawn with tasers.
  - tweak: Disabler beams now go through windows and grilles.
  - tweak: Disabler beams now do 33 stamina damage instead of 34. This means they
      will only stun in 3 hits on someone that is NOT 100% healthy.
  - tweak: Most ballistic projectiles now do stamina damage in addition to their regular
      damage instead of stunning. This includes nuke op c-20r .45, detective's revolver,
      etc. They are effectively better than disablers at stunning people, as well
      as do significant damage, but they do not stun instantly like a taser. Expect
      engagements to be a little longer and plan ahead for this.
  - rscadd: Added an advanced taser for RnD, the child of a disabler and a taser.
  Tkdrg:
  - rscadd: Envoys from the distant Viji sector have brought an exotic contraption
      to Centcomm. Known as the 'supermatter shard', it is a fragment of an ancient
      alien artifact, believed to have a dangerous and mysterious power. This precious
      item has been made available to the Space Station 13 cargo team for the cost
      of a hundred supply points, as a reward for all your hard work. Good luck, and
      stay safe.

      Repulse throws objects and creatures within 5 tiles of the caster away and stuns
      them for a very short time. Distance thrown decreases as the distance from the
      caster increases. (Max of 5, minimum of 3) Casting it while standing over someone
      will stun them for longer and cause brute damage but will not throw them.'

  - rscdel: Hotline no longer exists. Poppies now have Saline-Glucose Solution.
  - rscdel: Muriatic Acid, Caustic Soda, and Hydrogen Chloride have been removed,
      along with the secondary meth recipe. The original recipe still works.
  - experiment: Foam now produces more bang for your buck when mixed. Your foam grenades
      should be larger now to account for the slowdown.
  - rscadd: Adds Stabilizing Agent. This chemical will prevent the effects of certain
      reactions from taking place in  the container it is in, such as Smoke Powder
      and Flash Powder, allowing you to get the raw forms of the powders for heating
      up later.
  - rscadd: Smoke Powder and Flash Powder can now be mixed along with Stabilizing
      Agent in order to produce a powder version of the effects. You can then heat
      these powders to 374K to get the effects.
  - rscadd: Mixing them without Stabilizing Agent gives the default effects.
  - rscadd: Adds Sonic Powder, a chemical that deafens and stuns within 5 tiles of
      the reaction. It also follows the reaction rules of the other 2 powders.
  - tweak: Liquid Dark Matter and Sorium also now work like the powders do.
  - tweak: CLF3 now has a higher chance of making plating tiles, and the burn damage
      caused by it scales based on your fire stacks.
  - rscadd: Adds Pyrosium. This reagent heats up mobs by 30 degrees every 3 seconds
      if it has oxygen to react with. Useful for when you want a delayed mix inside
      of someone.
  - rscadd: Adds Cryostylane.  This reagent does the opposite of Pyrosium, but it
      still requires oxygen to react with.
  - rscadd: Adds Phlogiston. This reagent ignites you and gives you a single fire
      stack every 3 seconds. Burn damage from this chemical scales up with the fire
      stacks you have. Counter this with literally any chemical that purges other
      chems.
  - experiment: Smoke now transfers reagents to the mob, and applies touch reactions
      on them. This means smoke can run out of reagents, no more infinite acid smoke.
      It also only works on mobs, use the new Reagent Foam(tm) for your hellfoam needs.
      I suggest a CLF3 Fluoroacid Black Powder mix.
  - experiment: Added a derelict medibot to the code, will place a few on the derelict
      when this PR is merged as to prevent mapping conflicts.
  - rscadd: Adds Initropidril. 33% chance to hit with 5-25 TOX damage every 3 seconds,

      heart to stop. Get it from the traitor Poison Kit.
  - rscadd: Adds Pancuronium. Paralyses you after 30 seconds, with a 7% chance to
      cause 3-5 loss of breath. Get it from the traitor Poison Kit.
  - rscadd: Adds Sodium Thiopental. Knocks you out after 30 seconds, and destroys
      your stamina. Get it from the traitor Poison Kit.
  - rscadd: Adds Sulfonal. +1 TOX per 3 seconds, knocks you out in 66 seconds. Mix
      it with Acetone, Diethylamine, and Sulfur.
  - rscadd: Adds Amantin. On the last second it is in you, it hits you with a stack
      of TOX damage based on how long it's been in you. Get it from the traitor Poison
      Kit.
  - rscadd: Adds Lipolicide. +1 TOX unless you have nutriment in you. Mix it with
      Mercury, Diethylamine, and Ephedrine.
  - rscadd: Adds Coiine. +2 TOX and +5 loss of breath every 3 seconds. Get it from
      the traitor Poison Kit.
  - rscadd: Adds Curare. +1 TOX, +1 OXY, paralyzes after 33 seconds. Get it from the
      traitor Poison Kit.
  - rscadd: Adds a reagent_deleted() proc to reagents for effects upon the last time
      it processes in you, like with Amantin.
  - bugfix: Neurotoxin required temperature for mixing has been set to 674K, it was
      370K for some reason.
  xxalpha:
  - rscadd: 'Added Cybernetic Implants: Security HUD, Medical HUD, X-Ray, Thermals,

      lingering effects are not reversed however.
  - rscadd: Improving Summon Events will reduce the average time between events, but
      not the minimum time between events.
  - rscdel: Departmental Uprising has been made admin only for being an RP heavy event
      that creates antags in an enviroment that doesn't really support that.

      station's security vendors.
  - rscadd: Nanotrasen Security helmets are designed for easy repairs in the field.
      Officers may remove their Seclite attachment with any screwdriver, and the camera's
      assembly may be pried off with a crowbar. The assembly is also compatible with
