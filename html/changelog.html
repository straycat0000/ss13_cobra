Lots of sugar can make you a bit jittery at times. Eating food with vitamin (new reagent) counteracts the sugar effects and can give you temporary buffs when well fed: it lowers your chance to catch or spread viruses,it makes your body's metabolism more efficient that is it keeps healing reagents longer and evacuate toxins faster and reduces damage from radioactive reagents.

				<li class="rscadd">After the years of extensive research into xenobiology, and thousands of scientists lost to the slimes, we have finally come to admitting that we don't have a clue how they work. However, we've outlined a few facts, and managed to breed a new kind of slimes. They will be shipped to your station on the next shifts. They are different from the ones they are used to in the following:</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Their sight is better than ever, and now they can finally see things that are not directly pressed against them. Beware, they may appear more aggressive!</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Their memory has also become better, and they will now remember the people who fed them. As a note, you need to grab the monkey or push it to show to the slime that you're giving it to them, and it's not just walking in.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Apparently, not only we have studied them, but they have also studied us. Slimes are now capable of showing various emotions, mimicking humans. Use it to your advantage.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">There are reports of slimes showing signs of sentience. Further research is recommended.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">One of the reported signs is their speech capability. Following facts have been gathered: they talk more often to those who feed them; they react to being called by the number, but 'slimes' is also acceptable; they are able to understand being ordered to "follow" someone, or "stop". There is a report of slime releasing the assistant after a scientist shouted at it, and then calmly ordered a slime to stop.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">We've made a modification of a health scanner that is intended for the use on slimes. Two are available in the smartfridge.</li>
