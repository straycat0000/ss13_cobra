		<li class="rscadd">Mining has been significantly overhauled. Hostile alien life has infested the western asteroid! Miners are given an equipment voucher to obtain equipment to protect themselves.

		<li class="rscadd">Weapons that do no damage play a tap sound. The exceptions are the bike horn, which still honks, and the banhammer, which plays adminhelp.ogg. Surely nothing can go wrong with that last one.</li>

		<li class="bugfix">You won't get the "armour has blocked an attack" message for harmless attacks anymore.</li>
		<li class="rscadd">Adds 5 force to the lighter when it's lit. Same as when you accidentally burn yourself lighting it.</li>

		<li class="bugfix">Fixes a bug with the energy blade that kept it at weight class 5 after it was deactivated. Who cares, it disappears upon deactivation.</li>
		<li class="tweak">Changes the welder out of fuel message slightly to be less fragmented.</li>
		<li class="tweak">Removes dead air from a lot of weapon sound effects to make them more responsive. In other words, the fire extinguisher attack sound will play a lot sooner after you attack than before.</li>

		<li class="rscadd">Constructable machines now depend on R&amp;D; parts!</li>
		<li class="rscadd">DNA scanner: Laser quality lessens irradiation. Manipulator quality drastically improves precision (9x for best part) and scanner quality allows you to scan suicides/ling husks, with the best part enabling the cloner's autoprocess button, making it scan people in the scanner automatically.</li>
		<li class="rscadd">Clone pod: Manipulator quality improves the speed of cloning. Scanning module quality affects with how much health people will be ejected, will they get negative mutation/no mutations/clean of all mutations/random good mutation, at best quality will enable clone console's autoprocess button and will try to clone all the dead people in records automatically, together with best DNA scanner parts cloning console will be able to work in full automatic regime autoscanning people and autocloning them.</li>
		<li class="rscadd">Borg recharger: Capacitors' quality and powercell max charge affect the speed at which borgs recharge. Manipulator quality allows borg to be slowly repaired while inside the recharges, best manipulator allows even fire damage to be slowly repaired.</li>
		<li class="rscadd">Portable power generators: Capacitors' quality produce more power. Better lasers consume less fuel and reduce heat production PACMAN with best parts can keep whole station powered with about sheet of plamsa per minute (approximately, wasn't potent enough to test).</li>
		<li class="rscadd">Autolathe: Better manipulator reduces the production time and lowers the cost of things(they will also have less m_amt and g_amt to prevent production of infinity metal), stacks' cant be reduced in cost, because thatll make production of infinity metal/glass easy</li>
		<li class="rscadd">Protolathe: Manipulators quality affects the cost of things(they will also have less m_amt and g_amt to prevent production of infinity metal), best manipulators reduces the cost 5 times (!)</li>
		<li class="rscadd">Circuit imprinter: Manipulator quality affects the cost, best manipulator reduce cost(acid insluded) 4 times, i.e. 20 boards per 100 units of acid</li>
		<li class="rscadd">Destructive analyzer: Better parts allow items with less reliability in. Redone how reliability is handled, you now see item reliability in the deconstruction menu and deconstructing items that has same or one point less research type level will rise the reliability of all known designs that has one or more research type requirements as the deconstructed item. Designs of the same type raise in reliability more. Critically broken things rise reliability of the design drastically. Whole reliability system is not used a lot but now at least on the R&amp;D; part it finally matters.</li>

		Unstable anomalies have been spotted in your region of space. These anomalies can be hazardous and destructive, though our initial encounters with these space oddities has discovered a method of neutralization. Method follows.<br>
		<p>Step 1. Upon confirmation of an anomaly sighting, report its location. Early detection is key.<br>
		Step 2. Using an atmospheric analyzer at short range, determine the frequency that the anomaly's core is fluctuating at.</br>
		Step 3. Send a signal through the frequency using a radio signaller. Note that non-specialized signaller devices may possibly lack the frequency range needed.<br></p>
		With the anomaly neutralized and the station brought out of danger, inspect the area for any remnants of the anomaly. Properly researched, we believe these events could provide vast amounts of valuable data.<br>

		<li class="rscadd">Cameras, mulebots, APCs, radios and cyborgs can have signallers attached to their wires, like airlocks!</li>
		<li class="rscadd">Cameras have non-randomized wires and the power wire when pulsed will now toggle the camera on and off.</li>
		<li class="rscadd">Cyborgs have a new wire, the lockdown wire! It will disable/enable the lockdown of a Cyborg when pulsed.</li>
		<li class="rscadd">The traffic control computer (or more commonly known as the computer which lets you add NTSL scripts) will now have a user log, which will log all user activity. Other users can then view that log and see who has been uploading naughty scripts!</li>
		<li class="rscadd">NTSL has two new functions! time() and timestamp(format) will help you increase the range of types of scripts you can make, especially time(); since you can then make the scripts know the different between each execution by storing the results in memory.</li>
		<li class="rscadd">Two new advance disease symptoms! Their names are "Longevity" and "Anti-Bodies Metabolism". Have fun experimenting with them!</li>

		<li class="rscadd">Simplified detective stuff. The high-res scanner is gone and instead the detective's normal scanner will instantly report all fingerprints, dna and cloth fibers in full. This was needed because the system took too long to work with and disencouraged detectives. Not only that, it made detectives less of a threat for antagonists and made possible scenerios, such as framing someone by changing fingerprints with someone else, impratical. To replace the computer, the detective will have a full medical computer with access to it. Not only that, but his useless filing cabinet will be replaced with an empty one for serious investigators. Along with this, are fingerprint cards and built-in PDA scanning, as all of security had access to it which was really the detective's thing. The new scanner will also log every finding and you can print them out as a report by clicking the scanner while it is in your active hand.</li>

Please report any bugs to the bug tracker, I have tried everything that I can on my own but I'll need lots of people playing to fix the more minor bugs. You can find a guide to making your own diseases here: <a href='http://nanotrasen.com/wiki/index.php/Infections#Advanced_Diseases'>LINK!</a></li>

		<li class="wip"><font color='purple'><u>Admin-ranks changes</u><br>
		Lots of changes. This is just a brief summary of the most recent changes; still working on proper documentation.<br>
		All admins have access to view-vars, player-panel(for individual mobs), game panel and secrets panel. Most of the things on those pages have their own rights requirements. For instance, you can only use event orientated secrets in the secret panel if you have FUN rights. Debug secrets if you have DEBUG rights. etc.<br>
		Spawn xeno and toggle gravity procs were moved into the secrets panel (fun).<br>
		<a href='http://code.google.com/p/tgstation13/source/browse/trunk/config/admin_ranks.txt'>This</a> may help with understanding which flags do what. Unfortuanately it's still somewhat vague.<br>
		If you have any problems, feel free to PM me at irc.rizon.net #coderbus. I go by the username carn or carnie.

This has a few advantages: The 16(!) sacks of flour previously in the kitchen cabinet have been condensed to an equivalent 3 sacks. Beer is now brewable with universal enzyme, and converting lots of wheat into flour should be less tedious. Also, flour grenades, etc.  Because of this, flour is now obtained from the all-in-one blender rather than the processor, and spaghetti noodles are made with 5 units of flour in the microwave.</li>

Using the Lay-down verb will allow them to remain cloaked without depleting their plasma reserves,  hence allowing them to lay ambushes for unsuspecting prey. Should a hunter attack anybody, or get knocked down in any way,  they will become visible. Hopefully this allows for more strategic/stealthy gameplay from aliens. On the other hand, I may have totally  screwed the balance so feedback/other-ideas are welcome.</li>

The systems replaced were causing immense performance issues so the following are very necessary optimisations.<br>However, there is a downside: SS13 code is the equivilant of monkeys on typewriters. Despite weeks of constant coding/testing there -will- be things I've missed. The kinds of bugs I'm expecting are overlays not updating and/or in rare cases things not appearing in your hud. Most of these issues can be worked around simply by dropping the item and picking it back up. If all else fails ask an admin to regenerate your icons through view-vars.<br><u>Please</u> report any bugs to me on <b>#coderbus IRC</b> or <b>make an issue on the tracker</b> as a matter of urgency. I will fix them ASAP.<br>Also a massive thankyou to Nodrak, Erro, Pete and Willox. :)</font></li>

		<li class="rscdel">Reverted dismemberment, the recent gun changes, and Tarajans. Before you shit up the forums, read this:</li>
		<li>Dismemberment was ported from Bay12, but only halfway, and there were several problems with it. I know many people really liked it, but as it stood it did not fit the playstyle here at all. This <b>had</b> to be removed, there is work on a more fitting system, but this had to be taken out first regardless, and the longer people beat around the bush the worse the situation got.</li>
		<li>The gun change was made for no real reason and was pretty problematic, so reverting that should mean there are a lot less 'accidental suicides.'</li>
		<li>Tarjans were reverted by request as well, and since keeping them working after removing dismemberment would be a stupid amount of work.</li>

		<li class="wip">CONTRABAND-CON UPDATE: Added posters. I'm sorry to add it seperately with the rest of contraband, but there was a lack of sprites for everything else. Hopefully, people will gain interest and get me some damn sprites this way :3

                <BR><BR>How they get on-board: The quartermaster can now set the receiver frequency of his supplycomp circuit board. A bit simplistic as of now, will work on it later. Building a supplycomp with a properly set up circuitboard will give access to the Contraband crate.
                <BR><BR>How they're used: Unfold the rolled poster on any wall or r_wall to create the poster. There are currently 17 designs, with the possibility of me adding more.
                <BR><BR>How to get rid of them: You can rip them using your hand... To cleanly extract them and not ruin them for future use, however, you can use a pair of wirecutters.
                <BR><BR>How they're classified: They're contraband, so it's perfectly okay for security officers to confiscate them. Punishment for contraband-providers (or end-users, if you want to go full nazi) is up to the situational commanding officers.

	<li>What <b>ARE</b> newscasters? Fans of the Transmetropolitan series might find them familiar. Basically, they're terminals connected to a station-wide news network. Users are able to submit channels of their own (one per identified user, with channels allowing feed stories by other people or, if you want the channel to be your very own SpaceJournal, being submit-locked to you), while others are able to read the channels, either through the terminals or a printed newspaper which contains every news-story circulating at the time of printing.</li>
	<li>About censorship: You can censor channels and feed stories through Security casters, found in the HoS'es office and the Bridge. Alternatively, if you want a channel to stop operating completely, you can mark it with a D-Notice which will freeze it and make all its messages unreadable for the duration it is in effect.

	<li>Basically I think of the newscaster as nothing more as an additional Roleplaying tool. Grab a newspaper along with your donuts and coffee from the machines, read station rumors when you're manning your desk, be a station adventurer or journalist with your very own network journal!</li>
	<li>I would ask for a bit of respect when using the machine, though. I removed all and any channel and story restrictions regarding content, so you might end up seeing channels that violate the rules, Report those to the admins.</li>
	<li>Finally, due to the removal of the enforced "Channel" string, it's recommended to name your channels properly ("Station Paranormal Activity Channel" instead of "Station Paranormal Activity", for example")

	<li><b>Doohl updated</b>:
	<ul>
		<li>Bugfix: Metroids should never "shut down" and just die in a corner when they begin starving. And so, hungry Metroids are a force to be feared.</li>
		<li>The Cargo computers now have the ability to cancel pending orders to refund credits. This was put in place so that idiots couldn't waste all the cargo points and run off. However, if the shuttle is en route to the station you won't be able to cancel orders.</li>
		<li><font color='blue'>Bugfix: the manifest has been fixed!</font> Additionally, the manfiest is now updated realtime; job changes and new arrivals will be automatically updated into the manifest. Joy!</li>

	</ul>		
	<li><b>Agouri updated</b>:
	<ul>
		<li>I was always bothered by how unprofessional it was of Nanotransen (in before >Nanotransen >professionalism) to just lay expensive spacesuits in racks and just let them be. Well, no more. Introducing...</li>
		<li>Suit Storage Units. Rumored to actually be repurposed space radiators, these wondrous machines will store any kind of spacesuit in a clean and sterile environment.</li>
		<li>The user can interact with the unit in various ways. You can start a UV cauterisation cycle to disinfect its contents, effectively sterilising and cleaning eveyrthing from the suits/helmets stored inside.</li>
		<li>A sneaky yordle can also hide in it, if he so desires, or hack it, or lock it or do a plethora of shady stuff with it. Beware, though, there's plenty of dangerous things you can do with it, both to you and your target.</li>
		<li>The Unit's control panel can be accessed by screwdriving it. That's all I'm willing to say, I'd like to let the players find out what each hack option does and doesn't. Will add more stuff later.</li>
		<li>Added Command Space suit, Chief Engineer space suit and Chief Medical Officer spacesuit (In a new space that you'll probably notice by yourself) to make it easier for you to look like a special snowflake.</li>
		<li>EVA and CMO office modified to accomodate the new suits and SSUs. Look, I'm not a competent mapper, okay? Fuck you too. A mapper is strongly recommended to rearrange my half assed shit.</li>
		<li>Soda cans, cigarette packets, cigarettes and cigars as well as bullet casings are now considered trash and can be picked up by the trashbag. Now you can annoy the janitor even more!</li>
		<li>Sprite credit goes to Alex Jones, his portfolio can be found here: <a href="http://bspbox.com/">http://bspbox.com</a>. Thanks a lot, bro.</li>
		<li>With the recent forum fuss and all that, I've got a thread to specifically contain  rants and bug reports about this update. <a href="http://tgstation13.servehttp.com/phpBB3/viewtopic.php?f=3&amp;t=5569&amp;p=45549&amp;sid=a4a96f5b0e896cd3e3f7c1db73f09f1b#p45549">Click me</a></li>

While most Metroids have never shown signs of self-awareness, they do exhibit signs of basic logic and reasoning skills as well as very sophisticated perception. Nanotrasen has shipped two baby Metroids for the xenobiology department. They should be handled with the utmost care - they are some of the deadliest beings in the known universe!</li>

	<ul>
		<li>Backpacks removed from all players. It was unrealistic. You can now had to the living quarters to get one from the personal closets there.</li>
		<li>Any firearms now send you to critical in 1-2 shots. Doctors need to get the wounded man to surgery to provide good treatment. Guide for bullet removal is up on the wiki.</li>
		<li>Brute packs and kelotane removed altogether to encourage use of surgery for heavy injury.</li>
		<li>Just kidding</li>
		<li>Fireaxe cabinets and Extinguisher wall-mounted closets now added around the station, thank Nanotransen for that.</li>
		<li>Because of Nanotransen being Nanotransen, the fire cabinets are electrically operated. AIs can lock them and you can hack them if you want the precious axe inside and it's locked. The axe itself uses an experimental two-handed system, so while it's <u><font color='red'>FUCKING ROBUST</u></font> you need to wield it to fully unlock its capabilities. Pick up axe and click it in your hand to wield it, click it again or drop to unwield and carry it.You can also use it as a crowbar for cranking doors and firedoors open when wielded, utilising the lever on the back of the blade. And I didn't lie to you. It's fucking robust.</li>
		<li>Fireaxe, when wielded, fully takes up your other hand as well. You can't switch hands and the fireaxe itself is unwieldy and won't fit anywhere. 
		<li>A fireaxe cabinet can also be smashed if you've got a strong enough object in your hand.<li>
		<li><b>EXTINGUISHER CLOSETS</b>, made by dear Erro, can be found in abundance around the station. Click once to open them, again to retrieve the extinguisher, attack with extinguisher to place it back. Limited uses, but we've got plans for our little friend.

		<li>Oh, and tou can now construct Light floors!

	<LI>"One Click Queue" added: When you quickly click on two things in a row, it will automatically queue the second click and execute it after the default 'action delay' of 1 second after the first click.

<h5>08.02.2011, r999-1000</h5>
<ul>
	<LI>The amount of power the station uses should be lower.
	<LI>The singularity now changes size based upon how much energy it has
	<LI>New Machine: Particle Accelerator.
	<LI>It might need a better name/sprite but when put together properly and turned on it will shoot Accelerated Particles.
	<LI>The particles irradiate mobs who get in the way and move through solid objects for a short time.
	<LI>The Particle Accelerator parts are set up by using a Wrench followed by a Cable Coil, then finished with a screwdriver.
	<LI>When you shoot the Singularity Generator with Accelerated Particles it will spawn a Singularity.
	<LI>New layout for Engineering, might be changed up slightly in the next few days.
</ul>
	
<h5>06.02.2011, r979</h5>
<ul>
	<LI>Jesus christ it's a new map what the fuck
	<LI>Just kidding, it's only minor changes to medbay/mechbay/cybernetics/R&amp;D/toxins/robotics/chapel/theatre
	<LI>Okay so there's too many changes to list completely, but basically: toxins/R&amp;D/virology/xenobiology are south <i>through</i> medbay; robotics/cybernetics/mechbay are where toxins used to be, the theatre and chapel are above medbay.
	<LI>Theatre is a new place for the Clown and Mime to play, there are some costumes available, a stage and backstage, and seating for the audience.
	<LI>R&amp;D and Toxins have been combined together. R&amp;D is still work in progress. You need to head south through medbay to get there.
	<LI>Medbay has been re-arranged slightly. Honestly, it's nothing, I bet you won't even notice anything different. There's also a new surgery suite, complete with pre-op and post-op rooms. 
	<LI>Virology's been rearranged, but it is mostly in the same place still.
	<LI>Xenobiology is work in progress. [There's some fun stuff still being coded]
	<LI>The Chapel is now to the north. You'll probably be thinking something like "Goddamn, this place is fucking huge", but it's actually smaller than the previous chapel.
	<LI>Robotics and related stuff is also work in progress - however, everything needed for making borgs is there. Note: de-braining will now be done by surgeons in medbay, rather than roboticists in robotics, in case you're wondering where your optable went.
	<LI>I added color-coded pipes in the areas I was working on. Red pipes run from air siphons and feed into the waste loop; blue pipes run from air vents and pump whatever atmos is set to pump. Yeah, there's TWO pipe networks on the station, who knew? Well, some of you probably did, but I didn't!
	<LI>Please bring all complaints/ideas/suggestions/bugfixes to: <a href="http://tgstation13.servehttp.com/phpBB3/viewtopic.php?p=14971#p14971">This awesome thread on our forums</a>
	<LI>This update brought to you by: veyveyr and Rookie, with help from friends! [Now you know who to strangle, please be gentle q_q]
</ul>

<h5>05.02.2011, r968</h5>
<ul>
	<LI>This really needs to be updated more often.
	<LI>Various map updates have been applied with many more to come. Expect overhauls! 
	<LI>Mining system nearing completion.
	<LI>Massive overhaul to the electricity systems, the way singularity makes power, and various related functions.
	<LI>Mime spawns with White Gloves instead of Latex Gloves (apparently there's a difference!)
	<LI>A new event has been- CLANG! What the fuck was that?
	<LI>Ion storm laws should be much more interesting.
	<LI>Security reports should no longer list traitor heads/AIs as possible revs/cultists, nor should nuke operatives ever get named for anything.
	<LI>Pens are much more versatile and user friendly.
	<LI>Mech building is rapidly on its way! Ripleys can be built, consult your quartermasters.
	<LI>Traitors now have several new things they can steal.
	<LI>Some surgeries coded to accompany the new operating room and surgery tools.
	<LI>Research and Design is continuing development and should be rolled out shortly.
	<LI>Various sprites added, tweaked, scrapped and fixed.
</ul>

<h5>14.01.2011, r853</h5>
<ul>
	<LI>Changlings Overhauled. Now function kinda like alium (using an internal chemical reserve instead of plasma) with each ability requiring a certain amount of chemicals to activate. Both venoms removed. Several "Dart" abiliites added. They allow the changling to deafen, blind, mute, paralyze, or even transform (dead) targets.

	<LI>Carded AIs no longer take damage while in unpowered areas.
	<LI>Chaplains can now name their religion at round start.
	<LI>New Recipies: Clown Burger (1 Clown wig, 5 flour), Mime Burger (1 beret, 5 flour), Cuban Carp (1 carp fillet, 1 chili, 5 flour).

</ul>

	<LI>Robotic Transformation (from Robrugers) and Xenomorph Transformation (from xenoburgers) now curable.
	<LI>Mining added. Only accessible by admins (and those sent by admins). Very much WIP.
	<LI>Alium Overhaul. Divided into multiple castes with distinct abilities.
	<LI>New AI Modules: The goody two-shoes P.A.L.A.D.I.N. module and it's evil twin T.Y.R.A.N.T. Only the former actually spawns on the station.
	<LI>Lizards added. They run away and shit.
	<LI>PDA overhaul. Doesn't change anything for humans, just makes coders happy.
